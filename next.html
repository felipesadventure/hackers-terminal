  <h2>I'll try to stay away from spoilers, so I won't really get into what happens, but I think the ending of the movie is one of the goofiest things I have seen in a while, and I absolutely love it. First there's the scene with the town, which is just kind of fun, but afterwards, it gets crazy. The things they do are just so clever and I was laughing the whole time.
Definitely go watch this movie(I think it's on Hulu) because it's pretty funny. I will say that there are a few jokes about rape that really didn't land for me, so I guess it has aged a bit in terms of that, but it's still a great movie.</h2>
